1.  Concept Concept 
Blobs is a 2D puzzle game where players control adorable blob creatures with unique 
behaviors and must merge and strategize their way through increasingly complex levels on a 
tiled board. 
2. Genre & Platform 
●​ Genre: Puzzle / Strategy 
●​ Art Style: 2D top-down with bubbly, soft-edged cartoon aesthetics 
●​ Target Platforms: Web, iOS, Android (initial development in Unity)​
 
3. Core Gameplay 
Objective: 
Merge blobs to clear the board while navigating merge constraints and special blob 
behaviors. Blobs can only be merged if they are on the same row or column. Blobs can not 
merge with other blobs sharing the same color (this does not apply to some special blobs) 
Core Loop: 
1.​ Select a Blob →​
 
2.​ Merge or Move toward a valid blob →​
 
3.​ Activate Blob Behaviors (Trail, Ghost, etc.) →​
 
4.​ Modify board state →​
 
5.​ Repeat until no blobs are left 
6. Visual Design 
Style: 
●​ Soft, bubbly characters with high color contrast​
 
●​ Minimal UI to keep focus on the board​
 
 
 
7. Progression & Levels 
●​ Levels start simple: merging two blobs 
●​ New mechanics introduced one at a time (e.g., Trail Blob, Ghost Blob, Sigil tile) 
●​ Puzzle difficulty increases through:​
 
○​ Tile layout complexity 
○​ Merge path restrictions 
○​ Complex blob behaviors  
 
8. Tutorial System 
●​ Step-by-step guides using text per action 
●​ Animations highlighting swipe direction and target tile 
●​ “Forced move” system 
4. Game Mechanics 
Blobs: 
Blob Type 
Description 
Can 
Initiate 
a Merge 
Normal Blob 
Standard unit for merging. 
Merges with like-sized/smaller 
blobs 
Yes 
Trail Blob 
Leaves a trail of blobs behind it 
after merging 
Yes 
Ghost Blob 
"Haunts" another blob’s space 
after merging 
No 
Flag Blob 
Goal point. A Blob of the same 
color can merge with it and it will 
clear both off the board. Only 
works when no other blobs are 
on the board 
No 
Rock Blob 
Obstacle that blocks direct 
merges 
No 
Switch Blob 
Turns the corresponding laser 
obstacle off  
No 
 
 
Actions: 
●​ Swipe-to-Merge: Merge by swiping from one blob to another, or by selecting the two 
one after the other. 
●​ Undo: Reverses last merge with animated step-by-step rollback. 
 
5. Systems & Patterns 
●​ Command Pattern: Used for executing and undoing merges. 
●​ Strategy Pattern: Used for custom merge behaviors per blob. 
●​ Plan/Chain Logic: Allows blob actions to traverse paths and modify plans based on 
what's encountered. 
10. Development Tools 
●​ Engine: Unity (2D pipeline using isometric camera setup) 
●​ Language: C# 
●​ Graphics: Custom sprites (Photoshop) 
●​ Animation: DOTween for movement, scaling, easing 
●​ Version Control: Git​
 
11. Stretch Goals 
●​ Colorblind mode 
●​ Level editor for custom puzzles 
●​ Story mode?
